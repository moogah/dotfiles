* Introduction
Avy is a package that provides quick navigation within visible text by jumping to characters, words, or lines.

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][Avy]] allows you to jump to visible text based on a character-based decision tree.
It's particularly useful for moving the cursor without using the mouse or multiple arrow key presses.

* Lexical Binding
Enable lexical binding for better closures and variable scoping.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

* Configuration
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; ===============================================================================
;; Configure avy for quick navigation
;; ===============================================================================

(use-package avy
  :straight t)
#+end_src

* Usage
Some common avy commands:

- `avy-goto-char`: Jump to a character
- `avy-goto-char-2`: Jump to a sequence of two characters
- `avy-goto-line`: Jump to a line
- `avy-goto-word-1`: Jump to a word starting with a character

In Evil mode, there's already a keybinding set up for avy-goto-line:
#+begin_example
(evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "<SPC> j") 'avy-goto-line)
#+end_example
