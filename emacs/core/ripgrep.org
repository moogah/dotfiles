* Introduction
Ripgrep is a fast code searching tool similar to grep, ack, or ag, but significantly faster.
It's used by several Emacs packages like projectile-ripgrep for code searching functionality.

[[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][Ripgrep]] provides extremely fast text searching in repositories and is a foundation for 
efficient code navigation in Emacs.

* Usage
Ripgrep is primarily used as a backend for other packages, so there's no direct user interaction.
It's used by:

- `projectile-ripgrep`: Fast project-wide code searching
- `counsel-rg`: Ivy-enhanced ripgrep interface
- `consult-ripgrep`: Consult-enhanced ripgrep interface

For these to work, the `rg` command must be installed on your system:
- On macOS: `brew install ripgrep`
- On Linux: Use your package manager (e.g., `apt install ripgrep`)
- On Windows: Available via scoop, chocolatey, or direct download
