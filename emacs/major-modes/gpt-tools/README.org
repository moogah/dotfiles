#+title: GPTEL Tools Guide
#+author: Jeff Farr

* Introduction

This directory contains custom tools for gptel that can be used by LLMs to interact with
your Emacs environment. Tools are defined using =gptel-make-tool= and organized by category.

* What are GPTEL Tools?

GPTEL tools are elisp functions with metadata that LLMs can call to extend their capabilities.
When an LLM decides to use a tool, it provides arguments, gptel runs the function in Emacs,
and optionally returns the result to the LLM.

Tools enable LLMs to:
- Read and write files
- Execute commands
- Query databases
- Search the web
- Interact with Emacs buffers
- Control your Emacs environment

* Tool Definition Structure

** Required Parameters

Every tool requires these four parameters:

- =:name= :: Tool name in snake_case (e.g., "read_file", "create_buffer")
- =:function= :: The elisp function (lambda or symbol) that runs
- =:description= :: Verbose description of what the tool does, how to call it, and what it returns
- =:args= :: List of argument specifications (or nil for no arguments)

** Argument Specification

Each argument in =:args= is a plist with required keys:

- =:name= :: Argument name as a string
- =:type= :: Type as a symbol: =string=, =number=, =integer=, =boolean=, =array=, =object=, or =null=
- =:description= :: Description of what the argument represents

** Optional Parameters

*** For Arguments:
- =:optional= :: Boolean indicating if argument is optional
- =:enum= :: Vector of strings for enumerated types (e.g., =["read" "write" "append"]=)
- =:items= :: For =array= type, plist with at least =:type= of items
- =:properties= :: For =object= type, plist serializable to JSON object spec

*** For Tools:
- =:category= :: String for grouping in UI (default: "misc")
- =:async= :: Boolean for async functions (see Async Tools section)
- =:confirm= :: Boolean or function to prompt user before running
- =:include= :: Whether to include tool results in LLM output (useful for chat buffers)

* Basic Examples

** Simple Tool with One Argument

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gptel-make-tool
 :name "read_buffer"
 :function (lambda (buffer)
             (unless (buffer-live-p (get-buffer buffer))

             (with-current-buffer buffer
               (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max))))

                 (insert content)
                 (write-file full-path))

               :type boolean
               :optional t
               :description "Whether search is case-sensitive"))
 :category "search")
#+end_src

** Tool with Enum Arguments

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gptel-make-tool
 :name "open_file"
 :function (lambda (filepath mode)
             (let ((buf (find-file-noselect filepath)))
               (pcase mode
                 ("read" (view-buffer buf))
                 ("edit" (switch-to-buffer buf))
                 ("split" (switch-to-buffer-other-window buf)))

               :description "Full path to the file")
             '(:name "mode"
               :type string
               :enum ["read" "edit" "split"]
               :description "How to display the file"))
 :category "emacs")
#+end_src

** Tool with Array Arguments

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gptel-make-tool
 :name "delete_files"
 :function (lambda (filepaths)
             (mapconcat
              (lambda (path)
                (if (file-exists-p path)
                    (progn (delete-file path)
                           (format "Deleted: %s" path))
                  (format "Not found: %s" path)))
              filepaths
              "\n"))
 :description "Delete multiple files"
 :args (list '(:name "filepaths"
               :type array
               :items (:type string)
               :description "Array of file paths to delete"))
 :category "filesystem")
#+end_src

** Tool with Confirmation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gptel-make-tool
 :name "execute_command"
 :function (lambda (command)
             (shell-command-to-string command))
 :description "Execute a shell command and return output"
 :args (list '(:name "command"
               :type string
               :description "Shell command to execute"))
 :category "system"
 :confirm t  ; Always prompt user before running
 :include t) ; Include results in LLM output
#+end_src

* Async Tools

For long-running operations, mark the tool as =:async t=. The function should:
1. Take a callback as its FIRST argument (not included in =:args=)
2. Call the callback with the result when ready

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gptel-make-tool
 :name "fetch_url"
 :function (lambda (callback url)  ; callback is first arg
             (url-retrieve
              url
              (lambda (status)
                (if (plist-get status :error)
                    (funcall callback (format "Error: %s" (plist-get status :error)))
                  (goto-char (point-min))
                  (re-search-forward "\n\n")
                  (funcall callback (buffer-substring (point) (point-max)))))))
 :description "Fetch content from a URL asynchronously"
 :args (list '(:name "url"
               :type string
               :description "URL to fetch"))
 :category "network"
 :async t)  ; Mark as async
#+end_src

* Organization

Tools are organized by category in separate files:

- =filesystem-tools.org= :: File and directory operations
- =emacs-tools.org= :: Buffer, window, and Emacs introspection
- =system-tools.org= :: Shell commands and system interaction
- =network-tools.org= :: Web requests and API calls

Each =.org= file tangles to a =.el= file that is loaded by =major-modes/gpt.org=.

* Using Tools

** Selecting Tools

Tools can be selected from gptel's transient menu (=M-x gptel-menu=):
1. Navigate to the tools section
2. Select which tools to enable (globally or buffer-locally)
3. Configure confirmation and result inclusion settings

** Setting Tools via Elisp

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Set tools globally
(setq gptel-tools (list tool1 tool2 tool3))

;; Set tools for current buffer only
(setq-local gptel-tools (list tool1 tool2))
#+end_src

** Tools in Presets

Include tools in gptel presets for specific workflows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(gptel-make-preset 'coding-assistant
  :description "Assistant with file and buffer access"
  :tools (list read_buffer create_file list_directory))
#+end_src

* Tips

1. *Descriptive names*: Use clear, descriptive snake_case names
2. *Detailed descriptions*: LLMs rely on descriptions to understand when and how to use tools
3. *Error handling*: Always handle errors gracefully and return informative messages
4. *Security*: Use =:confirm t= for dangerous operations (file deletion, command execution)
5. *Return values*: Return strings that are useful as context for the LLM's next response
6. *Categories*: Group related tools with consistent category names
7. *Testing*: Test tools manually before relying on LLM to call them correctly
