* Install Transient and Transient Showcase

Transient appears to be installed already, though I'm not sure if it was included in the distribution or it came with magit.

Transient Showcase comes with a [[file:~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/transient-showcase/transient-showcase.org][literate org]] file for exploring

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package transient-showcase
    :straight '(transient-showcase :type git :host github :repo "positron-solutions/transient-showcase"))
#+end_src
